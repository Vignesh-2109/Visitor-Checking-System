# Visitor Checking System

## Overview
- Devised and executed a Visitor Checking System model with 97% accuracy by employing advanced one-shot learning techniques.
- Used ML models like HaarCascade to detect faces and FaceNet to convert faces into embeddings.
- Built a web app using Flask for real-time authentication.
## FaceVerification
Face verification for visitor checking system using siamese networks implemented using haarcascade for face detection and facenet for face verification.
Consists of functions to add,delete,verify faces.
